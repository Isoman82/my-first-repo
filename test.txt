Here is an example of a simple generator function in JavaScript:

function * genGen(i, max) {
	while ( i < max ) {
	  yield i;
	  i++
	}
  }

const genVar = genGen( 0, 9 )
console.log(genVar.next().value)

// console.log() is used here to output the value of the generator function

Note: Iterations can be run until the max value is reached
